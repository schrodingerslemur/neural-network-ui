# Drag-and-Drop Neural Network App
This project is a simple Scratch-style drag-and-drop programming environment built using [CMU Graphics](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/desktop).

It provides a block-based interface where users can drag, drop, and arrange visual code blocks to create different customizable neural network architectures - similar to beginner-friendly visual coding.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
## Installation and Usage
1) Download CMU Graphics from this [link](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/desktop).
2) Clone this repository.
3) Move the CMU graphics folder into the repository
```bash
mv cmu_graphics neural-network-ui/cmu_graphics
```
5) Install library requirements
```bash
cd neural-network-ui
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4) Run and open GUI
```bash
cd src
python main.py
```
